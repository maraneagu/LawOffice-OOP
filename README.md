# LawOffice-OOP

The second project implemented in the Object Oriented Programming course in my second semester at FMI.

Managing a law office: 
- you can see all the lawyers currently working in the law firm, with their respective clients;
- you can add new lawyers and new clients for each of the lawyers in the firm.
